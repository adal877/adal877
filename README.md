### About me 
* I have studied C language for one and a half year now  
* Using linux as primary OS since 2013, when my computer suddenly stoped to working with windows 7  
  (error: no operational system found, solution: install Ubuntu ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)  
* Since 2014 I'm studying bash and mainly RegEx  
* for while I did only one project in [Processing](https://processing.org) on [Open Processing](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1232029).  
  It's a simple Random walker.
