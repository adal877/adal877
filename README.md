    </summary>

### About me  
* I have studied C language for one and a half year now  
* Using linux as primary OS since 2013, when my computer suddenly stopped work with windows 7  
  (error: no operational system found, solution: install Ubuntu ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)  
* Since 2014 I'm studying bash and mainly RegEx  
* for while I did only one project with [p5.js](https://p5js.org) on [Open Processing](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1232029) (take a look).  
  It's a simple random walker, but I made several other codes, just did not upload yet (for a while).  
* Currently using [Halmak keyboard layout with brazilian accents I did](https://github.com/adal877/xkb-layouts)  
* For while, I didn't work as a professional programmer, but I'm looking for any opportunity  

 
### IDE 
[![Vim Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/VIM-%2311AB00.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=vim&logoColor=white)](https://vim.org)  
I have been using Vim for 5 years, but just now I'am comfy enough while using my [vimrc](https://github.com/adal877/Myvimrc.git) (take a look).  
I used VisualStudio for 7 months on ubuntu, during a college project... I did not liked or hated,  
I can only say that if I have to use any other IDE than Vim, I will choose VS.
